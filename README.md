In alignment with SDG goal 3 (Good health &wellbeing) set by the United Nations to reduce the rate of under 5 child mortality in the world to 25% per 1000 birth, the parties involved have been working towards this objective and hence the need to access the status of under 5 child mortality rate over the years and recommend for the future appropriately.

### OBJECTIVES

The objectives of this project are clearly stated below;
 - To describe the prevalence of under-5 child mortality rate in the selected African countries

 - To analyze and identify possible causes of high under-5 mortality rates in the selected African countries

 - To forecast the possible trend of under-5 mortality rate in the selected African countries from 2020-2025

 - To recommend possible solutions for mitigating the under-5 mortality rate in the selected African countries.

### DATA SOURCE
Data used for this project is a secondary data source from http://ourworldindata.org. A sample of the top countries for 5 African Regions based on population size was taken and analyzed based on stated objectives.

### KEY INSIGHTS

- The 5 selected countries from Northern Africa have all achieved the SDG target of under 25%
- the prediction shows that none of the remaining selected African countries can achieve under 25% child mortality rate by 2025
- Mortality rate for all selected countries decreases as we advance in age
- Nigeria has the highest under 5 mortality rate amongst selected countries
- Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases are the major cause of child mortality in Africa
